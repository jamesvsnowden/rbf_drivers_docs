This guide will walk you through RBF Drivers, an add-on for
<a href="https://www.blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a>
that enables you to quickly and easily create advanced drivers that use 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_network">radial basis function networks</a>.

Don't worry if you don't know what radial basis functions are, we'll explain everything you need
to know, as well as how they radically improve Blender's rigging and animation capabilities.

Even if you're familiar with RBF networks or have used similar systems available in software such as
<a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/" target="_blank">Maya</a> or
<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/" target="_blank">Unreal</a>, we strongly recommend you start
by reading the [overview](/user-guide/overview) to get a feel for how RBF Drivers works and the kind of things
you can do with it.
