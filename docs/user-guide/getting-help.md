# Getting Help

You can get in touch through whichever third-party service you used to purchase RBF Drivers, or
alternatively use the [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/y6jTAURSj2).

## Bugs

RBF Drivers is tested on each and every release, but 3D software is complicated and from time to
time bugs arise. If you think you hvae found one, get in touch so it can be resolved, but before
doing so please ensure that the cause of the problem lies with RBF Drivers and not elsewhere.

If you're able to provide a file containing the issue, or one that illustrates it, as well as a
description.

## Suggestions

If you have a suggestion about how RBF Drivers can be improved, please do get in touch. If it's
viable and not already part of the roadmap, it would be greatly appreciated.
