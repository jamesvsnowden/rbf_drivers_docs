# Installation

Once you've downloaded RBF Drivers you should have a file named **rbf_drivers.zip**.
Don't unzip the file, instead open Blender and then open the preferences from the edit menu.

Select the **Add-ons** pane from the menu on the left and click the **Install** button.
Navigate to the location of the downloaded zip file and click **Install Add-on**.

Find the **RBF Drivers** add-on in the list of add-ons (it's in the Animation category) and
check the box next to it to enable the add-on.

You're now ready to go, but it is strongly recommended to read through the other sections of
this guide first to make sure you get the most out of the add-on.
